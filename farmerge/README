== Usage ==
Execute "farmerge.sh --help" for global usage.

Per-module usage can be retrieved by executing a module with the "--help"
argument. Currently, most modules lack and useful usage. (See "Bugs".)

== More Information ==
We maintain a detailed manual for farmerge on our wiki:

== Bugs ==
This list may be incomplete. See http://neuvoo.org/bugs for a complete list.
 * Sync module is very much locked down to Neuvoo setup. Making it flexible is
   not going to be super easy.
 * Modules lack very helpful usage. Until that support is added, detailed usage
   is documented inside each module.
